        The very first step in this checklist is to decide if you want a pair of
        gaming headphones or a pair of gaming headsets.
      </p>
      <p class="checklist__text">
        So what is the difference between gaming headphones and gaming headsets?
      </p>
      <p class="checklist__text">
        Gaming Headphones = Regular Headphones + Separate Mic Gaming headphones
        are regular headphones that are used traditionally for music enjoyment.
        However, they possess qualities that are awesome for gaming needs too.
        Audiophilic characteristics such as great micro-detail retrieval,
        accurate sound stage and immersive sound experience make them feasible
        to double up as a pair of gaming headphones.
      </p>
      <p class="checklist__text">
        However, most audiophile headphones do not come with a mic nor do they
        have any mic attachment slots. You will need to get an external mic like
        the Blue Yeti X for communication support.
      </p>
      <p class="checklist__text">
        A professional gamer who uses a gaming headphones setup is Ninja, famous
        for streaming PUBG and Fortnight. He uses the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro
        with Audio Technica AT2035 Cardioid Condenser Microphone while streaming
        his games.
      </p>
      <p class="checklist__text">
        There are several benefits and drawbacks to using a gaming headphones
        setup for gaming.
      </p>
      <p class="checklist__text">
        Benefits of Gaming Headphones Higher upsides for audio and mic quality
        As you have a wider product selection for both the headphones and mic
        itself, you are able to assemble your gaming setup with the latest mic
        and headphones.
